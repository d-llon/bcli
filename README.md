# BigCommerce CLI

`bcli` is BigCommerce store management on the command line. It brings the most commonly used store management tools to the terminal for quick actions and multi-storefront workflows. `bcli` was written to help tech savvy store managers save time by ditching BigCommerce's browser based admin UI.
